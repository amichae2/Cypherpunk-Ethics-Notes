## Notes
- ***Introduction***
	- Timothy May
		- Intellectual founder of crypto anarchism
			- Use crypto to promote anarcho capitalist way of life
	- Julian Assange
		- Use crypto to promote justice
	- > Here, I will use the terms "crypto anarchy" and "crypto justice" to elucidate the philosophical divergences between May and Assange's respective cypherpunk ethics.
	- This and the next chapter will explore meta-ethics
		- Ask questions about nature of morality itself
		- Three important meta-ethical issues
			- Moral semantics
				- > Meta-ethical inquiry can clarify the meaning of moral terminology
			- Moral epistemology
				- > Meta-ethical analysis can establish how we come to have knowledge about morality and provide standards of the justification of moral claims
			- Moral ontology
				- > Meta-ethical reflection seeks to determine the nature of moral claims, whether they are objective or subjective, universal or relative, and so on.
			- Robert J. McShea adds a fourth
				- Theory of human nature
		- When analyzing cypherpunk meta-ethics concerned with, "The ideas of language, knowledge, and human nature that cypherpunks have in mind when they form those beliefs about what is right and wrong."
	- Anarcho Capitalists
		- Non-coercion principle
			- > Personal Liberty is best achieved when each individual is allowed to choose what kind of life they live free of coercion from others, including governments.
	- Assange
		- Believes humans are good by nature but corrupted by corrupt societies
	- Crypto anarchy
		- Individual freedom is central value
	- Crypto justice
		- Prizes the virtues of justice and courage
- ***Timothy May's Crypto Anarchy***
	- "Crypto anarchism is the cypherpunk version of anarcho-capitalism"
		- Anarcho-capitalism
			- > Human societies would be freer and better organized if governments were abolished and all human relationships and institutions were goverened by market forces alone
			- Non-coercion principle
				- > Humans are only truly free to the extent that all their actions and decisions are undertaken without the influence or control by other people... Libertarian society is "a society in which each person is free to do as he likes with himself and his property so long as he does not use either to imitate force against others"
			- "Values are neither objective nor universal"
				- Freedom is only important because it seems most people want it and it allows people to pursue their other values
				- > If every individual knows best what they want, and if every individual knows best what is good for them, then non-coercive market relations enable the kind of freedom that each person needs to pursue their wants and realize their goods
- ***Julian Assange's Crypto Justice***
	- > I (Julian Assange) have a single goal, not a very original one but a definite goal to my life, which is to help in the creation of a more just society to live in. I am not for transparency all round, or even democracy all round, but I am for justice.
	- Assange is a virtue ethicist
		- Virtue ethics does not tell what the right action is, it tells what makes someone a good person
		- Humans are good or innocent by nature and become corrupted by decadent cultures
		- > Assange seems to believe that the natural decency of human beings deteriorates under the influence of negative social influence, and he seems to argue that justice can only be realized by maintaining one's virtue in the face of depraved social norms and structures.
		- Justice is a universal standard used to measure the moral standing of governments and legal systems
		- "Justice is realized through retribution or the imposition of fitting punishments for those who commit unjust acts"
		- Wrondoers deserve punishment and the innocent deserve to be protected
		- "The most unjust people obtain underserved goods for themselves at the expense of others, and for Assange, these viscious bastards must be punished if true justice is to prevail."
		- Justice provides universal standards for the distribution of reward and punishment
		- >The bastards who commit injustices have unfortunately surrendered their natural virtue and adopted "the accumulated vices of civilization," often obsessively seeking positions of power from which they can take more for themselves at the expense of vulnerable others.
		- >Simple inaction as a response to witnessed injustice corrodes one's character. Though digital communication technology enables greater connection with others and the world, it also makes possible the mass disintigration of good character
			- Only way to prevent one's character from "disintigration" is through the cultivation of courage
			- Courage
				- "The intellectual mastery of fear by understanding the true risks and opportunities of the situation and keeping those things in balance"
	- "Crypto can be used to alter the landscape of risk and opportunity, thereby lowering the "courage threshold".
- ***Conclusion***
	- Moral semantics
		- Neither May nor Assange prioritize the clarification of moral language
	- Moral ontology (May)
		- "Moral values cannot be universal and objective"
	- Moral ontology and epistimology (Assange)
		- ""Knoiwing" justice is a matter not of learning it but of not forgetting it"
	- > In May's crypto anarchist worldview, the primary moral conflict is between a small elite who demand libertarian freedom and the slavish masses who worship the welfare state. In Assange's crypto justice worldview, however, the primary moral conflict is between the few viscious bastards who use their power to commit heinous acts of injustice and the few virtuous individuals who draw upon their courage to fight for true justice

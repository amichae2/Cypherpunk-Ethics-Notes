## Notes
- ***Privacy for the Weak, Transparency for the Powerful***
	- In 1992 a group of computer activist met to discuss their growing concerns about the threats to privacy in the digital age
		- The group considered the name "Cryptology Amateurs for Social Irresponsibility" but settled on "**the cypherpunks**"
		- Created "A Cypherpunk' Manifesto"
			- Written by Eric Hughes, John Gilmore and Timothy C. May
			- Digital communications are antithetical to privacy
			- Privacy is "The power to selectively reveal oneself"
	- In the mid-1990s Julian Assange joined the cypherpunks and wrote "Conspiracy as Governance"
		- Argues that cryptography could not only be used to protect the people but also to promote transparency in institutions
	- Privacy:
		> Something that individuals and relatively powerless organizations are permited by right and guaranteed by encryption
	- Secrecy:
		> Something that powerful organizations use to hide their nefarious, unjust and anti-democratic plans
	- Vulnerability:
		> Describes the condition of individuals when their personal data is known by others (especially without their knowledge or consent)
	- Transparency:
		> Condition of organizations and institutions when their data is made available to publics
	- "By advocating privacy for the weak and transparency for the powerful, the cypherpunks hope to shift the balance of power, taking power from corporate and government elites and returning it to the people"
- ***Hackers, Cyberpunks, and Cypherpunks***
	- Hackers generally believe
		> That computers could improve people's lives, that access to computers ought to be unfettered, that systems of centralized authority ought to be replaced with decentralized systems, that people should take a hands-on approach to technology, and-perhaps most famously-that all information should be free
	- Cyberpunks
		> A science fiction movement that descibes the future of industrial countries, depicting the influence of mass telecommunications upon the lives of individuals and societies
	- Cypherpunks
		- rooted in work of independent cryptographers in the 1970s
		- many are anarcho-capitalists
			- reject cyberpunk fear of corporate power
		- draw inspiration from other literature
			- ex: Geaorge Orwell
- ***Toward a Cypherpunk Ethics***
	- **This book provides a philisophical look at the ethical, political, social, economic, and technological aspects of the cypherpunk worldview**
	- Cypherpunk worldview based on claims of what institutions ought to do and what societies ought to be like
	- philosophize about conceptions of human nature, theories of meta-ethics, and definitions of freedom
	- prefer technological over legislative solutions to social and ethical issues
	- include people identifying as anarcho-capitalist libertarians, mainstream conservatives, left liberals, Wobblies, Marxists, etc
